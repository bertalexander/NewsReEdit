                  <p> The diversity report of  the Fall 2016 is here, and while growth was made, there is still much room for improvement. </P>

                  <p>With exciting, diverse castings at Yeezy Season 3 and Zac Posen, things looked promising at the beginning of Fashion Month in New York. But alas, the momentum stalled when things carried on to Europe, with cities like Milan and London making little to no improvements in casting. </p>

                  <p>Diversity on the Runway is a serious issue and it is great to see New York designers taking serious strides to change the make-up of the runways.</p>

                  <p>For the full report, head over to The Fashion Spot.

                    <p>Pop-up shops are a trend in retail, so of course Kanye West had to jump on board.</p>

                    <p>Fresh off the presentation of Yeezy SZN 3 a few weeks ago, Kanye West has decided to open up a pop-up shop. The catch is, it isn’t for his Yeezy line.</p>

                    <p>The pop-up shop is actually in support of his latest album (read: masterpiece), <i>The Life of Pablo</i>.</p>

                    <p>Highlights include custom denim jackets and tees.  The shop is limited though, only staying open for 3 days.</p>
